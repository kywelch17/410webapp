# 410webapp

This is my 410 Web Application, as part of ICSI 410 - Intro to Database Final Project. This app connects to a SQL Database to perform basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) concepts. It emulates a mock university, and will be able to edit student and teacher tables. Can also accept/decline login attempts with the create login credentials, when the faculty accounts create the student accounts. 

 What did I learn:
 - Learned about PHP, Hypertext Preprocessor
 - SQL language and the MySQL software
 - Relations in a Database
 - Web Development
 - WAMP Server
 
 *NOTE: This project has some changes that need to be conducted, and I simply haven't had time to apply them.*
